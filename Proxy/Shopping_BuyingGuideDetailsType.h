 Information that identifies a buying guide. A buying guide contains content about particular

 to purchase based on their particular interests.
 Buying guides are useful to buyers who do not have a specific product in mind.
 For example, a digital camera buying guide could help a buyer determine what kind of
 digital camera is right for them.

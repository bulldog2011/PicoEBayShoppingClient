 Applicable to sites that support the Detailed Seller Ratings feature.
 The FeedbackRatingDetailCodeType is the list of areas for detailed seller ratings. When buyers leave an overall Feedback rating (positive, neutral, or negative) for a seller, they also can leave ratings in four areas: item as described, communication, shipping time, and charges for shipping and handling. Users retrieve detailed ratings as averages of the ratings left by buyers.

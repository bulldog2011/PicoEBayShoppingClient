/**
 
 Free is used when the seller is declaring that shipping is free for the buyer.
 Since Free cannot be selected via API, the seller has two options for
 signifying that shipping is free when listing an item:
 <br>
 - omit shipping details, mention in the item description that shipping is
 free, and set ShippingTermsInDescription to true
 <br>
 - select an arbitrary shipping service and set its shipping cost to 0, mention
 in the item description that shipping is free, and set
 ShippingTermsInDescription to true
 <br>
 The latter is a better way to communicate "free shipping" because eBay picks
 up the "0" cost and can more accurately identify shipping costs in search
 results.
